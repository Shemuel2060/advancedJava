There are several approaches to searching and sorting arrays. 

Searching approaches include: 
    1. linear search, which involves looking at each item in the 
    array to find whether the one desired is there,
    
    2. binary search which involves diving the array into two halves, 
    and looking for the item in the half where it is most likely to be.

    already sorted arrays.
